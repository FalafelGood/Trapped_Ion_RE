# Trapped_Ion_RE
Resource estimation for lattice surgery in trapped ion systems

This repository consists of:
* Quirk circuits in html format which interactively demonstrate various elements of the distillation protocol.
* Jupyter notebooks of varying degrees of importance. At the time of writing these include:
      * PairFidelity.ipynb (Main working draft for simulating resource estimation)
      * PairFidelity (Simplified).ipynb (Simplified version of the above which Hudson has been using for debugging)
      * CircuitSimulation.ipynb (Initial first draft -- mostly scrap at this point)
      * QST (Qiskit).ipynb and QST (Stim).ipynb (Code for Quantum state tomography experiments. (Less important than initially expected, so essentially dead)
